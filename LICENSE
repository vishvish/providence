By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and
conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License (the "Public
License"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the

Section 1 -- Definitions.

a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or
   based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged,
   transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar
   Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a
   musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed
   Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.

b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions
   to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.

c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright
   including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights,
   without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the
   rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.

d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may
   not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty
   adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.

e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to
   Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the
   Licensor applied this Public License.

g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public
   License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed
   Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.

h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.

i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under
   the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination,
   communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members
   of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.

j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the
   European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended
   or updated from time to time, and/or other similar rights anywhere in the world.

k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has
   a corresponding meaning.

Section 2 -- Scope.

a. License grant.

   1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a
      worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the
      Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

       a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and

       b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

   2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to
      Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and
      conditions.

   3. Term. The term of the license granted under Section 2(a)(1) is specified in Section 6(a).

   4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the
      Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make
      technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any
      right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the
      Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological
      Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this
      Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.

   5. Downstream recipients.

       a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material
          automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the
          terms and conditions of this Public License.

       b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material. Every recipient of Adapted Material
          from You automatically receives an offer from the original Licensor to exercise the Licensed
          Rights in the Adapted Material under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.

   6. No Surrender of Others' rights. The Licensor does not by this Public License grant You any
      rights in the Licensed Material that the Licensor does not have the authority to grant. For example,
      the Licensor is not authorized to grant rights in Your patents or trademark rights that apply to the
      Licensed Material.

b. Other rights.

   1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are
      publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the
      Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent
      necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.

   2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.

   3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise
      of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or
      waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves
      any right to collect such royalties, including when the Licensed Material is used other than for
      non-commercial purposes.

Section 3 -- License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.

       a. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to be
          credited as provided ("Attribution Parties"), in a reasonable manner based on the medium,
          means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. The credit required under this
          Section 3(a) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case
          of Adapted Material You must also include a credit identifying the source of the Licensed
          Material and a notice that the Licensed Material has been modified.

       b. a copyright notice.

      the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.

   4. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium,
      means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to
      include the required information in a human-readable "credits" or "about" section if the Licensed
      Material is embedded in a website or app.

b. ShareAlike. In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share Adapted Material You must
   distribute the Adapted Material under the same license as the Licensed Material (i.e., this Public
   License) or a later version of this Public License.

c. No additional restrictions. You may not apply legal terms or technological measures that legally
   restrict others from doing anything the license permits.

Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed
Material:

a. for the purpose of this Public License, the Licensor grants You the rights to extract, reuse, reproduce,
   and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;

b. if You Share all or a substantial portion of the database, then the Sui Generis Database Rights that
   apply to the database must be licensed under the same terms and conditions as those that apply to the
   Licensed Material; and

c. if You combine the database with other data so as to create a larger database, the rights in the larger
   database that result from such combination (but not the rights in the individual contents of the
   databases) are not automatically subject to the terms of this Public License.

Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the
Licensed Material as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed
Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of
title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or the absence of latent or other
defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where
liability cannot be limited as a matter of applicable law, liability is limited to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable law.

Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if
   You fail to comply with this Public License, then your rights under this Public License terminate
   automatically.

b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:

   1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided the Licensor does not notify You of
      the termination by some reasonable means; or

   2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

c. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek
   remedies for violations of this Public License.

Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.

a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You.

b. The waiver or failure to assert any right or provision of this Public License shall not be deemed a
   waiver of such right or provision.

   1. a "person" includes a natural person, corporate or unincorporated body (whether or not
      incorporated or formed under the law of any jurisdiction);

   3. the headings are for reference purposes only and do not affect interpretation.
